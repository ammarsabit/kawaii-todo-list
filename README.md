# 🐰 Kawaii TodoList (Design Only)

This is a mini front-end project that showcases a cute and responsive to-do list interface built with **HTML** and **CSS** only. The design features a soft, pastel-colored theme with kawaii-style bunny illustrations, rounded elements, and intuitive icons for task actions. Although it doesn’t include functionality with JavaScript yet, the layout is structured in a way that it can be easily extended in the future.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building the base layout and styling task elements with **Flexbox** and **semantic HTML** was straightforward and enjoyable.
- The **most challenging part** was making the design responsive—especially managing the absolute positioning of the decorative bunny images and ensuring consistent alignment across different screen sizes.
- I overcame layout issues by using `vh`, `vw`, `%` units and `media queries`, and refined the look by balancing positioning with layering using `z-index`.
