# 🐰 Kawaii TodoList — Fully Functional Version

A cute, responsive, and now fully interactive Todo List web app built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Inspired by soft pastel aesthetics and kawaii visuals, this project allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks — all stored in the browser using **localStorage**.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible structure
- **CSS3** – responsive design, flexbox, and media queries
- **JavaScript** – DOM manipulation, event delegation, localStorage
- **SVG Sprites** – used for icons like add, delete, and check
- **Google Fonts** – custom typography with DynaPuff

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building interactivity with **vanilla JavaScript** — including DOM events, localStorage, and toggling classes dynamically.
- Managing tasks between active and completed states while maintaining a clean user experience.
- Improving my understanding of **event delegation** and **closest()**, especially when dealing with dynamic elements.
- Structuring reusable SVG icons using **sprite-based references** with `<use>`, which kept my assets light and scalable.
